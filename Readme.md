# Big-mart-Sales-data-Analysis

In this brief project, I have downloaded a very popular dataset – Big Mart Sales from Kaggle and have tried to fit an appropriate Machine Learning model that can provide me with an estimated price given several features about the item.

The model with the best R2 fit and the least Mean Squared Error is picked to be the one that will be applied to the dataset. We then tune the hyperparameters a little and come up with a working application ready model.

# Objective

The input dataset is an Excel file with information about sales of 8523 items sold at Big Mart. 
For each item sold, in addition to the price at which the item was sold, the dataset contains 
additional features such as the weight, MRP, the type, the year at which it was sold and 11 
such others. 

The steps we will go through are: 
1. Data pre-processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model training 
4. Model validation 
5. Model predictions 
6. Visualization of results

For accurate prediction of the Outlet sales price of a given item, we have used certain state-of-the-art regression algorithms like – Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression. 

Result - We see that the XGBoost Regressor performed best on our dataset, with the lowest Mean Squared error of around 800. Not surprisingly, it had the highest R2 score too, indicating that it fit our model the best.
